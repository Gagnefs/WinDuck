# WinDuck

![PLACEHOLDER](./docs/assets/Title-Screen.png)

WinDuck is my complete guide on how to set up Windows 11 for as much performance and privacy without installing a single program.

The goal for this guide is to make *making Windows 11 usable* as easy as possible, so anybody with any amount of experience can follow it :)

WinDuck does *not* contain any programs or scripts that I have made (trusting another stranger on the internet feels like a bad idea...), instead it uses [Winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil?tab=readme-ov-file) and [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/), both of which do not install anything.
